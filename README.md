# *Extended* Jupyter Cell Tags support in VS Code

This extension provides extended support for notebook cell tags and cell run groups in Visual Studio Code.

I needed more functionality and was tired of fussing with the Jupter/VSCode/Powertoys version hell, so I forked the repo implemented it myself. My pull request on the official repo is here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter-cell-tags/pull/40, but there seems to be no progress on merging it.

After this, I added custom run groups to work around https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-jupyter-powertoys/issues/90 and believe I improved the expierence (at least for myself) over the Jupyter Powertoys version, as it allows an arbitrary number of run groups with custom names.

This fork is available on marketplace here:

- Cell Run Groups allow you to execute all cells with a given tag. You can select tags to run from the menu **Excecute Tag Run Group** or via the similarily named command.
    Tags that start with the "run-" prefix will appear first in the run list. ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9640d8f3-63e0-4fd9-9b9c-95c74eb8fa9d)

## 2025-02-25 - on macOS, I had to remove `nodenv` from path (an alternative to `nvm` for managing node versions) and move `nvm` up onto path. Also ahve to run with `zsh` instead of `bash`.

# 2025-02-26 - IMPORTANT - Finally got extension debugging working reliably

https://vscode.dev/editor/profile/github/62d11f2ed58b3e59527093d8318c1847

In `.vscode\launch.json`, I had to add a fixed extension debugging profile: `"--profile=PhoExtensionDev2025",`
```json
		{
			"name": "Run Extension",
			"type": "extensionHost",
			"request": "launch",
			"args": [
                // "--profile-temp",
				"--profile=PhoExtensionDev2025",
				"--extensionDevelopmentPath=${workspaceFolder}",
                // "--disable-extensions",
                "--enable-proposed-api",
                "phohale.jupyter"
			],
			"outFiles": [
				"${workspaceFolder}/out/**/*.js"
			],
			"preLaunchTask": "${defaultBuildTask}",
		},

```
